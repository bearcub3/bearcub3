### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github!    
My name is `Go-Un` aka `Emilie`!    
I love working on solving complex problems transitioning to approachable and easy-to-use designs.    
I have extensive experience working with the web along with HTML, CSS and general UI design.  

If you are interested in my academic writings, please visit my LinkedIn.    
I am interested in working in a multidisciplinary role in conjunction with front-end development and UX design.   
As a proponent of Inclusive design and User-centred design, my learning will continue and I would love to work with people whose views align with mine.

### Hi there 👋

I am a visionary designer and more like an architect who perceives things holistically and joins the dots systematically.
Design is not only about creating a minimalistic and aesthetic user interface but creating a seamless end-to-end user experience design backed by data within the iterative product development cycle.

As a human-centred designer, I'd like to shift how business people think about design. Your business could make an impact on a cultural level if you invest more in design and research, and allow designers to lead the product or at least foster a culture where designers could thrive.
In turn, your target users, customers and the public will see the changes, and that's where design can bring more value and revenue for businesses, not just by creating a tangible output.

We can take the initiative to make such an impact in society together.
Hire me!

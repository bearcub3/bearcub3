### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wecome to my github!    
My name is `Go-Un` aka `Emilie`, I am an ex-designer who trasitioned to become a developer    
after moving to the U.K from Seoul, South Korea at the end of 2017.    
I'd love working on solving complex problems transitioning to approachable and easy-to-use design.
My life-long learning with web development continues.   
I am not actively looking for a job to focus on my study at the moment    
as an immigrant and a woman with career break, I decided to study in Information Technology.

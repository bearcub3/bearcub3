### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wecome to my github!    
My name is `Go-Un` aka `Emilie`, I am an ex-designer who trasitioned to become a developer    
after moving to the U.K from Seoul, South Korea at the end of 2017.    
I love working on solving complex problems transitioning to approachable and easy-to-use designs.
My life-long learning with web development continues.      
As an immigrant and a woman with a career break, I decided to study Information Technology in the UK. 
If you are interested in reading my tech blog, check [this](https://bearcub3.hashnode.dev/) out.

Update:    
I have retained excellent grades overall; if you are interested in reading my literature reviews and other work related to my IT degree, please visit my Linkedin. I am also looking forward to studying further in Human-Computer Interaction Design at City, university of London later this year.

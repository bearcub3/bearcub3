### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wecome to my github!    
My name is `Go-Un` aka `Emilie`, I am an ex-designer who trasitioned to become a developer    
after moving to the U.K from Seoul, South Korea at the end of 2017.    

I am a talented and professional woman with extensive experience in web/editorial design.    
Are you interested in looking at my UI and UX design?

I'd like to be more specialized in `Front-end development in conjunction with UX`,    
however, I am studying hard to gain a better working knowledge in back-end development as well.    
My life-long learning with web development continues.     

```
My current tech stacks are 

Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JS, REACTJS, REDUX, REACT NATIVE, SASS, CSS-In-JS, WEBPACK(deployed my website successfully!) 
Back-end: Python, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, Nodejs, Expressjs
Design: Adobe Photoshops, Figma
```

I'd love to work with talented, intelligent people who know the value of diversity and inclusivity!!!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github!    
My name is `Go-Un` aka `Emilie`!
I love working on solving complex problems transitioning to approachable and easy-to-use designs.
I have extensive experience working with the web along with HTML, CSS and general UI design. 
However, as a woman with a career break and a non-traditional engineering background to work as a professional career woman,    
I decided to study further in Human-Computer Interaction Design at city, the University of London in order to reinforce my knowledge and experience in the field.    
Prior to study in HCI design, I have been studying Information Technology as English is not my mother language.    
And I have been retained excellent grades overall. If you are interested in my academic writings, please visit my LinkedIn.    
I am interested in working in a multidisciplinary role in conjunction with front-end development and UX design.   
As a proponent of Inclusive design and User-centred design, my learning will continue and I would love to work with people whose views align with mine.
